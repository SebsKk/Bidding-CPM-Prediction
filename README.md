# Bidding-CPM-Prediction

## Project Description

This project focuses on the prediction of the Cost Per Mille (CPM), a commonly used metric in the advertising industry. The CPM represents the cost an advertiser pays for one thousand advertisement impressions on a web page. Understanding and predicting CPM is crucial for both publishers and advertisers to optimize their bidding strategy in the online advertising ecosystem.

This project leverages a variety of machine learning techniques including linear regression, random forest, and deep learning models, along with the usage of feature embeddings for categorical variables to predict CPM values based on various parameters like site ID, advertisement type, geographic location, and more.

##  Key Files and Directories

Data_Exploration.ipynb: This notebook includes all the steps for data cleaning, exploration, and preprocessing. The dataset was cleaned for any missing values and outliers. Categorical variables were handled using appropriate encoding techniques.

Model_experimenting.ipynb: This notebook contains all the machine learning models tested for predicting CPM values. It includes linear regression, random forest, and deep learning models with embedding layers for categorical variables.

Dataset: This directory contains the raw and processed data files used in this project.
